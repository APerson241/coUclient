                <p>Children of Ur is a game about exploring, imagination, having fun with friends, imagination (did I already say that one?)...</p>
                <p>When you first start out in the world, you have no money, items, or imagination. Your goal is to <del>get as much of these as you can</del> have fun.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="2">Alrighty then...</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-2">
                <p>To get more money (shown at the bottom left of your screen), you can collect currant quoins (the brown floaty-spinny things) to get enough to buy a pick, then mine rocks. Or dig dirt. Or harvest something. But whatever you collect, you can sell it to vendors (the floating brown things that follow you creepily) for money.</p>
                <p>You can get imagination points (shown at the top left of your screen) the same way, but with the purple quoins.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="3">Sounds easy enough.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-3">
                <p>But there's a catch! While you're doing this, you need to watch your energy and mood meters. They are the things at the top left, next to your face.</p>
                <p>I mean, having low energy won't kill you (yet) and having a low mood won't affect the amount of imagination you get (yet), but it's good to get in the habit of watching them.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="4">I'll watch them, I guess.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-4">
                <p>You <em>guess</em>? Well, I suppose that's good enough for me.</p>
                <p>If your energy ever gets really low and you can't find any energy quoins, just wait until that clock at the top right says 6:00am. I'm generous enough to give everyone a full energy tank each morning.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="5">Uh... thanks in advance.</a></div>

                <p>No problem. If you ever need anything, I'm here for you.</p>

                <p>So let's say you find something wrong in the game (or maybe you already have). How do you report it?</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="2">You're going to tell me whether I know it or not, so let's just say I don't know.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-bugs-2">
                <p>Good point. But you use the bug window!</p>
                <p>I'm about to open it for you. It it appears on top of me, just drag it away by the header (unless you use Firefox, in that case, I'm sorry).</p>
                <p>You can open it whenever you want by clicking the <a id="rwc-bugwindow-icon"><i class="fa fa-bug"></i></a> in the top right.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a id="rwc-bugwindow" class="rwc-button" goto="3">Open away.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-bugs-3">
                <p>So this is it.</p>
                <p>The first thing you need to do is select the report type. Is it a problem or a feature request? Don't tell me, I can't help you. Just pick the correct option.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="4">I'm not telling you anyway, it's a secret.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-bugs-4">
                <p>Now I want to know.</p>
                <p>The second thing is to type in a description of the feature or problem. Be specific (though note that the devs know where you are in the game, and have a log).</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="5">Well that's a bit creepy.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-bugs-5">
                <p><em>In the game.</em> They know where you are <em>in the game</em>.</p>
                <p>It's really not that much information, you can read everything it sends in the second box.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" goto="6">That's not bad at all!</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-bugs-6">
                <p>No, it's not. Not nearly as hard as fixing bugs sometimes.</p>
                <p>Just make sure to report any bugs you find.</p>
                <p>It's okay to ask for features that were in the original game that you really miss and you want us to prioritize them.</p>
                <p>You can <a href="http://childrenofur.com/help/#contact" target="_blank">contact the devs directly</a> if you need personal help.</p>
