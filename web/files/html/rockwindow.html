                <p>Children of Ur is a game about exploring, imagination, having fun with friends, imagination (did I already say that one?)...</p>
                <p>When you first start out in the world, you have no money, items, or imagination. Your goal is to <del>get as much of these as you can</del> have fun.</p>
                <div class="center"><a class="rwc-button" goto="2">Alrighty then...</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-2">
                <p>To get more money (shown at the bottom left of your screen), you can collect currant quoins (the brown floaty-spinny things) to get enough to buy a pick, then mine rocks. Or dig dirt. Or harvest something. But whatever you collect, you can sell it to vendors (the floating brown things that follow you creepily) for money.</p>
                <p>You can get imagination points (shown at the top left of your screen) the same way, but with the purple quoins.</p>
                <div class="center"><a class="rwc-button" goto="3">Sounds easy enough.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-3">
                <p>But there's a catch! While you're doing this, you need to watch your energy and mood meters. They are the things at the top left, next to your face.</p>
                <p>I mean, having low energy won't kill you (yet) and having a low mood won't affect the amount of imagination you get (yet), but it's good to get in the habit of watching them.</p>
                <div class="center"><a class="rwc-button" goto="4">I'll watch them, I guess.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-4">
                <p>You <em>guess</em>? Well, I suppose that's good enough for me.</p>
                <p>If your energy ever gets really low and you can't find any energy quoins, just wait until that clock at the top right says 6:00am. I'm generous enough to give everyone a full energy tank each morning.</p>
                <div class="center"><a class="rwc-button" goto="5">Uh... thanks in advance.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-5">
                <p>No problem. If you ever need anything, I'm here for you.</p>
                <div class="center"><a class="rwc-button" goto="6">Okay, talk to you later.</a></div>
