		This 'game' is very much in pre-alpha, as such everything you see or collect is temporary.
		Keep in mind that commands may change without warning, and things will break.
		<br>
		Report bugs at the project's page on <a
		href="https://github.com/ChildrenOfUr/coUclient/issues">Github</a>,
		<br>
		and send us suggestions by clicking the little <i class="fa fa-bug"></i> icon in the top right.
		<br>
		<br>
		That being said, I want you to know that we care about you loads and hope you'll have fun in our little
		world.
