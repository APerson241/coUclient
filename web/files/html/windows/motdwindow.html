		<p>This 'game' is very much in pre-alpha, as such everything you see or collect is temporary. Keep in mind that commands may change without warning, and things will break.</p>
		<p>Report bugs at the project's page on <a href="https://github.com/ChildrenOfUr/coUclient/issues" target="_blank">Github</a>, and send us suggestions by clicking the little <i class="fa fa-bug"></i> icon in the top right.</p>
		<p>That being said, we want you to know that we care about you loads and hope you'll have fun in our little world.</p>
